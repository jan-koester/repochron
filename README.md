# RepoChron - a git and Laravel based versioning and way back tool

## About RepoChron

The purpose of this lightweight app is to provide (and perspectively generate) versions of static files (especially JSONs) in an easy human-readable form. This is achieved by using the concept of a wayback machine with standard timestamps. It is the most intuitive way to retrieve the content of a file at any point in time. Using the timestamp as a URL parameter allows for easy citation.  

The app is based on the Laravel PHP framework and Git.  

Important note: Even though this build is already working in this very early version, it is more of a proof of concept and not intended for practical use yet.
